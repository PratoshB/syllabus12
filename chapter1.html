                    <p><strong>3.Explain the different models of DBMS with advantages and disadvantages.</strong></p>
                    <p>-> There are several types of DBMS data models that define how data is organized, stored, and accessed. The most common models are:
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Hierarchical Model:</strong> In this model, data is organized in a tree-like structure with a parent-child relationship. Each child has only one parent, but a parent can have multiple children.
                                <p>Advantages:</p>
                                <ul>

                    <p><strong>4. What is a relational database? How is it different from other database models?</strong></p>
                    <p>-> A relational database is a type of database that stores data in the form of tables, also called relations. Each table consists of rows (also known as records or tuples) and columns (also called fields or attributes). Each table usually represents one entity, such as students, employees, or products. The tables are connected to each other using primary keys (a unique identifier for each row) and foreign keys (which reference primary keys in other tables). This structure makes it easy to organize and relate data without duplication. Relational databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data. Popular relational database systems include MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.
                    <br><br> Relational databases differ from other database models like hierarchical, network, and object-oriented in terms of structure, flexibility, and ease of use. In a relational model, data is stored in separate tables and linked using keys, which makes it highly flexible and easy to modify or scale. In contrast, hierarchical databases store data in a tree-like structure, where each record has only one parent, making it rigid and less adaptable. Network models allow more complex relationships but are harder to design and maintain because of their graph-like structure. Object-oriented models store data as objects (like in programming), which is useful for handling complex data types but is more complex and less widely supported. Relational databases stand out due to their simplicity, consistency, and wide use of SQL, making them the most common choice in modern applications.</p>
                    <p><strong>5.What is data redundancy? How does DBMS help in reducing it?</strong></p>
                    <p>-> Data redundancy means storing the same data in multiple places, leading to wasted space and possible inconsistencies. For example, if a student's address is saved in several files, updating it everywhere becomes difficult and error-prone.
                        <br><br> A DBMS reduces data redundancy by storing data in a centralized way using tables linked through keys. Instead of repeating the same data, it is stored once and shared across related tables. This improves storage efficiency and keeps data consistent.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>6. Write differentiate between centralized and distributed database systems.</strong></p>
                    <p>-> The differences are:

                    <p><strong>7.Who is Database Administrator (DBA)? What are the major responsibilities of DBA?</strong></p>
                    <p>-> A Database Administrator (DBA) is a professional responsible for managing and maintaining a database system. The DBA ensures that the database is available, secure, and running efficiently. They act as the key person who controls access to the database, monitors its performance, and handles any issues related to data storage and retrieval.
                        <br><br> The main responsibilities of a DBA include installing and configuring the database software, creating and maintaining database structures, ensuring data security and privacy, performing regular backups and recovery, monitoring database performance, tuning the system for optimal speed, managing user access and permissions, and troubleshooting any database-related problems to ensure smooth operation.                    
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>8. Define normalization. Explain 1NF, 2NF and 3NF with suitable examples. Explain the normalization process with examples.</strong></p>
                    <p>-> Normalization is a process in database design used to organize data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them.<br><br>
                    <strong>1NF (First Normal Form):</strong> Data is in tabular form with atomic (indivisible) values.<br>
                    Example before 1NF: Courses = "Math, Science"<br>
                    After 1NF:<br>
                    StudentID | Name | Course<br>
                    101 | Ram | Math<br>
                    101 | Ram | Science<br>
                    <strong>2NF (Second Normal Form):</strong> 1NF + no partial dependency. Non-key attributes must depend on the whole primary key.<br>
                    Split student info from course info.<br>
                    <strong>3NF (Third Normal Form):</strong> 2NF + no transitive dependency. All attributes depend only on the primary key.<br>
                    Separate instructor details into a new table.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>9. Explain the terms: primary key, foreign key, and candidate key with examples.</strong></p>
                    <p>-> <strong>Primary Key:</strong> A unique identifier for each record in a table. Example: StudentID in Students table.<br>
                    <strong>Foreign Key:</strong> A field in one table that refers to the primary key in another. Example: StudentID in Enrollments refers to Students table.<br>
                    <strong>Candidate Key:</strong> A column or set of columns that can uniquely identify a record. Example: Both StudentID and Email can be candidate keys, but only one becomes the primary key.</p>

                    <p><strong>10. What is SQL? Explain its components and common functions.</strong></p>
                    <p>-> SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data using commands.<br><br>
                    <strong>Components of SQL:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>DDL (Data Definition Language):</strong> Used to define structure (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP).</li>
                        <li><strong>DML (Data Manipulation Language):</strong> Used to manage data (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).</li>
                        <li><strong>DCL (Data Control Language):</strong> Used to control access (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).</li>
                        <li><strong>TCL (Transaction Control Language):</strong> Used to manage transactions (e.g., COMMIT, ROLLBACK).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Common SQL Functions:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Aggregate Functions:</strong> COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), MIN()</li>
                        <li><strong>String Functions:</strong> CONCAT(), LENGTH(), LOWER(), UPPER()</li>
                        <li><strong>Date Functions:</strong> NOW(), CURDATE(), DATE_ADD()</li>
                    </ul>

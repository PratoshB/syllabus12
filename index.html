                    <p>With the implementation of the Education (Eighth Amendment) Act, 2073, the Higher Secondary Education Council has been 
                        abolished and the National Examination Board has become functional. The work related to affiliation school permission, 
                        scholarship, school operation, which was being done by the previous Higher Secondary Education Council, will be managed
                        by the local level and the work related to curriculum development, development and equivalence determination will be 
                        done by the Curriculum Development Center. The work related to the examination of Class 10 (SEE) and the examination of 
                        Classes 11 and 12 (SLCE) has been included within the jurisdiction of the National Examination Board. In addition, the 
                        responsibility of conducting the examination of Class 10 at the provincial level and guiding the examination of the entire
                        school education has been included within the scope of the National Examination Board.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As per the provisions of the Act, the main work of the National Examination Board, established for the conduct, management 
                        and upgradation of school education examinations, is focused on the development of the examination system. The National 
                        Examination Board is defined in the Education Act as an autonomous and corporate body with perpetual succession. The Board 
                        has its own separate seal for all its activities. All the functions that were being carried out by the Office of the Controller
                        of Examinations of the Higher Secondary Education Council are being conducted by the National Board. The movable/immovable 
                        assets and liabilities in the name of the Higher Secondary Education Council have been transferred to the Board.

                    <h2 class="title">About Computer Syllabus</h2>
                    <p>The Class 11 Computer Science syllabus under Nepal's National Examination Board (NEB) is designed to provide students with a 
                        foundational understanding of computing concepts, software, programming, and digital security. It introduces students to the 
                        computer system, including its architecture, microprocessors, memory units, input/output devices, and hardware interfaces. 
                        This helps students grasp the fundamental components of a computer and how they function together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The syllabus also covers the number system and Boolean logic, teaching students about different numerical representations like 
                        binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal systems, along with Boolean algebra and logic gates. This section is essential for 
                        understanding how computers process and store data. Additionally, students are introduced to computer software and operating 
                        systems, where they learn about different types of software, including system software, application software, and the role of 
                        operating systems in managing computer hardware and software.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A significant portion of the syllabus is dedicated to application packages, where students develop practical skills in using 
                        word processors, spreadsheets, and presentation tools. This hands-on section ensures they become proficient in creating and 
                        managing digital documents. Alongside this, students dive into programming concepts and logic, starting with algorithms and 
                        flowcharts before moving on to structured programming in C. This segment helps them build problem-solving skills and understand 
                        fundamental coding structures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The syllabus also includes an introduction to web technology, covering the basics of HTML and CSS, enabling students to design 
                        and structure web pages. Additionally, a module on multimedia teaches them about different multimedia components, graphics, and 
                        animation techniques. Finally, students explore information security and cyber law, learning about digital threats, cybersecurity
                        measures, and ethical and legal aspects of computing. This ensures they understand the importance of safe and responsible use of 
                        technology in the modern world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, the syllabus aims to equip students with both theoretical knowledge and practical computing skills, preparing them for 
                        advanced studies in computer science and future careers in technology.

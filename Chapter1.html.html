                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Introduction</strong>: A DBMS is software used to manage and manipulate databases, providing an interface for users to interact with the database.</li>
                                <li><strong>Objectives</strong>: The main objectives of a DBMS include data integrity, data security, concurrent access, and ease of data manipulation.</li>
                                <li><strong>Advantages</strong>: Some advantages include improved data consistency, efficient data retrieval, and better security control.</li>
                                <li><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Disadvantages include the cost of DBMS software, complexity in implementation, and the need for skilled personnel.

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Hierarchical</strong>: A database model that organizes data in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships.</li>
                                <li><strong>Network</strong>: A more flexible model compared to hierarchical, where multiple relationships between records are allowed.</li>
                                <li><strong>Relational</strong>: A database model that stores data in tables and defines relationships between them using keys (most widely used today).</li>
                                <li><strong>Entity Relational</strong>: A model that represents data in terms of entities and the relationships between them, often used in object-oriented databases.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                <li><strong>Domain</strong>: Ensures that a field contains only valid values, as defined by the domain (e.g., integer, string).</li>
                                <li><strong>Entity</strong>: Ensures that each record in a table is unique and identifiable by a primary key.</li>
                                <li><strong>Referential</strong>: Ensures that relationships between tables are consistent, typically enforced by foreign keys.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><h2 class="title">Keys</h2> Keys are used to identify and access data in a database efficiently. Types of keys include primary keys, foreign keys, and candidate keys.
                        </li>
                        <li><h2 class="title">Normalization</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Introduction</strong>: Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.</li>
                                <li><strong>Normal Forms</strong>: Normal forms are stages in normalization where data is divided into smaller tables based on rules to minimize duplication.</li>
                                <li><strong>1NF, 2NF, 3NF</strong>: These are the first three normal forms, which reduce redundancy and improve data relationships in a database.</li>
                                <li><strong>Advantages</strong>: It leads to less data redundancy, improved data consistency, and easier updates and maintenance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: It can lead to complex queries and performance issues when data is too fragmented.
                                </li>

                                <li><strong>Introduction</strong>: Centralized databases store all data in a single location, while distributed databases spread data across multiple locations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Advantages</strong>: Centralized databases are easier to maintain, while distributed databases provide better performance and fault tolerance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Centralized databases can be a single point of failure, whereas distributed systems can be more complex to manage.</li>
                                <li><strong>Comparison</strong>: Centralized systems are ideal for smaller, simpler applications, while distributed systems excel in large, complex environments requiring scalability and reliability.
